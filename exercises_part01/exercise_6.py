### Exercise 6: Summarizer ###

Write a function sum_up(number1, number2) that accepts two integers and sums up every
integer between the two numbers including the given integers (inclusive). Check if the second
number is greater than the first and display a message if itâ€™s not. The function returns the result as an
integer.
Example: if the function is called with 3 and 9, that is, sum_up(3, 9) the result is 42 because:
3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 42
