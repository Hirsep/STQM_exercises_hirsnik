### Exercise 7: Sequencer ###

Write a function sequence(number) that accepts an integer as argument. It then checks if the
given number is an integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive) and prints an error message if itâ€™s not. In case
the given number is between 0 and 9, the function prints the sequence of number from 0 to 9 on the
console without the given number. The function does not return anything.
For sequence(5)your output should look like the following:
0 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9
