### Exercise 3: Formatting ###

Write a function name_age() that accepts the name and age of a person. It then prints it on the
console in the following format:
Hello, NAME. You are AGE years old.
The function does not return anything. Use the input() function to read the name and age as a
string and an integer. Use at least three different methods to format the output, e.g. concatenation,
String format(), f-strings, â€¦ That is, print the greeting three times using different formatting
methods which produce the same output.
Your output should look something like the following:
Hello, Georg. You are 46 years old.
Hello, Georg. You are 46 years old.
Hello, Georg. You are 46 years old.
